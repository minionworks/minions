To make Dhokla at home, start by preparing the batter. Mix 1 1/2 cups of gram flour with 1/2 tsp salt, sugar, and turmeric powder. Add water to achieve a smooth consistency and let it rest for 10 minutes. Grease a cake tin with oil, add Eno salt to the batter, and pour it into the tin. Steam it in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes. Prepare a tempering by heating oil with mustard seeds, green chilies, and curry leaves. Add 1/2 cup water, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp sugar, and lemon juice. Pour this over the cooled Dhokla and garnish with coriander leaves and grated coconut. Enjoy your homemade Dhokla!
